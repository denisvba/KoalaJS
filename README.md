### FAQ

- **Why Koala?**

@nkborba is the only one able to ever answer that.


- **Why JS?**

This project was done previously in plain Java Swing. We wanted to see other options and we wanted also to use JS, as we already explored with Java, and we were using Python for other projects. 
It should be multiplatform, so C# was ruled out, and C++ was ruled out of our league at the time.
Electron was there, documented, in large scale usage, so why not JS?
